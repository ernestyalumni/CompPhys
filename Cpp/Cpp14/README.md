# Cpp14 - C++ code snippets and examples for C++11/C++14 standard

## Abstract

> C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98.  Furthermore, the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster. -*Bjarne Stroustrup*

This directory contains C++ code snippets and examples formulated entirely in the C++11/C++14 standard.  I sought to "borax" away any backwards-compatibility or previous code practices and to adopt anew best coding practices that are apt to this latest C++11/C++14 standard.
